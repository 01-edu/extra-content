### Welcome to the Extra-Content Repository of the 01 Content Team

This repository serves as a reference for the documentation on how to create and upload custom content into our platform.
Please take into account our approach before making **Issues**

Link to documentation: https://www.notion.so/01edu/Creating-and-uploading-custom-content-af712c05bd044e2e9a2296d2eb268b40

Also note that any filestructure represented in here is optional. 
So it's up to the **Content Creator** to determine their own filestructure.

You will find here the required files for custom content creation

Thank You :smile:
